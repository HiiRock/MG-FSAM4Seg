# SAM4CoreSeg
Fine-tuned SAM adaptation with multi-scale guidance for automated detection and RQD analytics in rock core imagery
Rock core logging is critical for evaluating rock mass quality, yet traditional manual measurement of rock quality designation (RQD) indicator from boreholes remains highly labor-intensive. To address the limitations of insufficient detection accuracy and generalizability in mainstream deep learning methods, we propose SAM4CoreSeg, a vision foundation model adapted for rock core instance segmentation, combined with a fine-grained RQD analytics method. SAM4CoreSeg adopts an enhanced multi-scale feature learning design that seamlessly integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder with additional decoders.
