# Introduction
Rock core logging is critical for evaluating rock mass quality, yet traditional manual measurement of rock quality designation (RQD) indicator from boreholes remains highly labor-intensive. To address the limitations of insufficient detection accuracy and generalizability in mainstream deep learning methods, we propose MG-FSAM4Seg, a vision foundation model adapted for rock core instance segmentation, combined with a fine-grained RQD analytics method. MG-FSAM4Seg adopts an enhanced multi-scale feature learning design that seamlessly integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder with additional decoders, where the encoder is further fine-tuned via low-rank adaptation.
